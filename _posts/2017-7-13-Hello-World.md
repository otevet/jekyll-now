This post will discuss the impressions from the first week at Metis Data Science bootcamp.


After many months of planning, researching and preparing, the summer cohort at Metis Data Science bootcamp finally started!
This year, the cohort began on July 5th, right after the holiday, which means that the first week was actually three days long, with a full week of material to go through.

After getting started with introductions of the fellow classmates and instructors and taking care of administrative business, we started reviewing some of the basic tools which we will be using in the next few weeks. These include: Jupyter notebooks, and the command line. We were also introduced to our very first project (and the only one in a group format). 

The first week went by very quickly, filled with pair programming challenges in the mornings, daily lectures to cover concepts such as statistics and python programming with various libraries, and working with our teammates to find, clean, and analyze MTA turnstile data. The following Monday, we presented our findings to the entire class. It was inspiring to see how different groups approached the same dataset differently, and came up with unique conclusions. Also, it was a huge relief and feeling of satisfcation, when my group recieved overwhelmingly positive feedback from the instructors and fellow classmates on our presentation.

After the first project was presented and delivered, we began focusing on our main topics for the second week: introduction to machine learning. We learned various topics such as linear regression to build the foundation for advanced machine learning and discussed web scraping with two different methods to acquire data from the internet. Our second project, Project Luther was introduced as well. We were to find, scrape, and aquire a dataset, and build models to predict a numerical outcome. We had complete freedom in choosing our topic, but to make it practical, we were instruced to wrap it around a business case/problem statement. 

As the second week at the bootcamp came to an end, I am extremely happy with my decision to go with Metis. The instructors and teaching assistant, administrative staff, and fellow classmates are all professional, positive, and smart- exactly the type of people who inspire you to learn and grow. 

I am thrilled and honored to be at Metis, and can't wait to gain more knowledge and skills, work on exciting projects, and build a strong foundation as a data scientist. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey in data science!
